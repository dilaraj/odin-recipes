My first HTML project - Odin Recipes Website

(18/01/2020)
This project will demonstrate the HTML basics that I have learnt so far in the Odin Project course. 

The project will consist of a main page index with links to various recipes. 

*Note: The website is mainly focused on HTML and will not contain any CSS so far


Self-Reflection (Upon Completion):
Once I completed the project I got a thorough understanding on how different files connect and work together to form a complete website through a layered structure. Through applying my knowledge in a real-life situation, I also understood how folders work to store certain files and group them together based on topic.
